This is a whooping number of employees that could leave at any time. 
## Summary:
* How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
As the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact a total of 72,458 roles will need to be filled.
* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
There are 1940 employees that are eligible to be mentors. Are there enough to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? it depends on how many roles become vacant at once. For example at my job there are different hiring classes ( Janurary class, February class). If we know that there are 500 employees retiring at the end of December for example we can split the number of new hires into two classses: January class with 250 new hires, and a February class with 250 new hires. After we can assign 2-3 mentees with there mentors for the next 1-2 months.
